## Story
I say that the best way to learn programming is to code something you like. In this instance I made a simple snake game which uses and modulus function to alternate the colors of the snake. 
## Installation
* game was tested with version 3.8 of python, but any python 3 version should work
* if your installation does not include graphical library tkinter you need to install it to run the game
